Hi, I'm [Lisa](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Lisa_Lionheart). If you ever need help ping me here on GitHub, or on irc @TaskClusterRobot (coming soon).

My favorite activities:
 - Commenting on issues and commits.
 - Leaving status updates on issues (pull requests)
 - Hanging out in IRC channels.
 - Merging commits.
 - Launching TaskCluster tasks (when asked)
 - Reading [Linux Poetry](http://linuxpoetry.com).
 - Listening to [Marina and the Diamonds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_oMD6-6q5Y).
